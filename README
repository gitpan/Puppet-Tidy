Puppet::Tidy

Puppet::Tidy is a Perl module and standalone application to verify that
Puppet manifests comply with the Puppet Style Guide which is available
here: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/style_guide.html.

It was developed after getting bored pretty quickly with manually fixing the
warnings emitted by the awesome puppet-lint tool.
